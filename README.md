Analysis-HR---Excel-Dashboard.
The result of my project is a data analysis - an interactive dashboard, showing analysis of key indicators related to human resources management. 
It contains basic information about the people employed by the company, such as: 
gender, age, type of contract, full-time equivalent, number of days absent and late, or the department in which they work. 
The database contains more than 2,000 records with data on employees employed by the company.
The .xlsx file is a workbook with 3 sheets (1 with an interactive dashboard, 1 with the database and 1 with tables and charts - a worksheet). 
I encourage you to leave feedback. Thank you!
